            Oh, so if you're expecting me to be making the paste from absolute scratch?
            Nah: we're good. Get a jar and make life easier on yourself. Oh and same for the 
            extra additions. Get the lazy squeezy tubes.</p>

                </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Thinly slice the chicken and place to one side.</li>
                    <li>Thinly chop the pepper, onion, and baby sweetcorn. Put them alongside
                         the mangetout in another pile.</li>
                    <li>Dump around a third of the curry paste into a work along with a splash
                         of olive oil and slowly heat.</li>
                    <li>After a couple of minutes, throw in the chicken. Stir and allow to simmer
                        for a few minutes.</li>
                    <li>Boil the water and dissolve the chicken stock in a jug.</li>
                    <li>Add the stock and coconut milk to the wok.</li>
                    <li>Throw the vegetables in.</li>
                    <li>Stir until everything is blended and then eyeball-squirt the lemon grass,
                         ginger and garlic paste <em>(just guesstimate, it won't kill you)</em>.
                        Bring to a simmer
                         and allow for the sauce to cook down. This usually take
                         between 45-60 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Cook the rice like it says on the packet. What am I, your mum?
                        When the curry has cooked down enough, whack it on the lowest heat possible
                         and fry the paraithas. Flip them until the begin to brown off and stick em on a plate.</li>
                    <li>Serve up the rice and curry in a bowl and eat the stuff.</li>
                </ol>
