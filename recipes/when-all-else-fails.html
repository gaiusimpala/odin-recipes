    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>You dried out the chicken. You cooked the curry down too far. It's Friday night
        and frankly you have nothing better to do. The weather is awful and you can't be
        bothered to go to the shop. 
    </p>
    <p>You know what to do.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Smart phone</li>
            <li>Credit card</li>
            <li>Just Eat app</li>
            <li>Hunger</li>
            <li>Apathy</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Get your phone out.</li>
            <li>Scroll through your local restaurants.</li>
            <li>Get bummed out because your favourite place isn't on there.</li>
            <li>Pick something you don't really want anyway and ignore the voice of reason in your
                head telling you that you're not really <em>that</em> hungry anyway and besides you 
                have stuff to make a pasta.</li>
            <li>Order with minimal shame and regret: save that for later.</li>
            <li>Check the tracker every five minutes.</li>
            <li>Get your delivery as quickly as possible and don't make eye contact with the driver
                as you don't have any change in the house to tip with.</li>
            <li>Serve, and try not to weep.</li>
        </ol>
        

        </ul>
